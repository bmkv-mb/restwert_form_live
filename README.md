# Project Customer form

Projekt Restwert ZÃ¼rich needed a tool to register new customers and maintain their data to incorporate them into their own ERP. The tool had to be accessible through their iPad tablets.


## Features

- Built in translation, if needed
- Access to databank and ability to perform changes to entries (currently limited to "Incorporated true/false")
- Filter and search options
- Responsive


## Installation

Since it's a simple setup and Projekt Restwert ZÃ¼rich is limited in their admin rights, we opted to use XAMPP.

Install XAMPP and drag-and-drop the contents of the folder into the htdoc. Start the APACHE and mySql process.
